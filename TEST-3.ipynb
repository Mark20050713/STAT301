    "\n",
    "Sleep plays a crucial role in maintaining physical and mental health. Disruptions in sleep quality or duration have been consistently associated with increased stress levels, cardiovascular risk, and metabolic issues such as obesity. As lifestyles become more demanding and sedentary, understanding how daily habits impact sleep health is both timely and essential. For this project, we use the Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset which contains 374 observations and 13 variables, covering sleep quality, daily activity, stress, and cardiovascular health. It includes numerical and categorical data, such as sleep duration (hours), self-reported sleep quality (1-10 scale), physical activity level (minutes/day), stress level (1-10 scale), BMI category, and presence of sleep disorders (None, Insomnia, Sleep Apnea). This dataset helps analyze the relationship between lifestyle choices and sleep health. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our inference-based research question is as follows:\n",
    "We wish to examine the association between a person's sleep duration and health-routine-related predictors such as BMI, physical activity level, sleep disorder, stress level, etc.\n",
    "Our question is primarily focused on inference, as our goal is to examine association intead of predicting values. By examining the model’s coefficients, we can interpret how each factor contributes to changes in sleep duration, providing insights into potential lifestyle adjustments for better sleep health.\n",
    "\n",
    "There’s already quite a bit of research highlighting how lifestyle choices are connected to sleep health. For example, Grandner (2017) points out that behaviors like physical activity and diet play an important role in sleep quality. Medic et al. (2017) explain how poor sleep can affect both mental and physical health, especially through stress and cardiovascular issues. Similarly, Khan and Aouad (2017) show links between sleep loss and cardiovascular risk factors like high BMI and blood pressure. These studies help back up the relevance of the variables we’re exploring and show why it makes sense to look for associations between them and sleep disorders in this project."

    "# Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "Our analysis explored the relationships between sleep duration and a range of predictors using a linear regression model applied to the Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset. The results provide valuable insights into the factors associated with sleep duration, while also highlighting the complexity of sleep health.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "The model identified several significant associations. SleepQuality and PhysicalActivity were positively linked to sleep duration, suggesting that better sleep quality and higher physical activity levels contribute to longer sleep. In contrast, StressLevel and SystolicPressure showed negative associations, indicating that elevated stress and blood pressure are linked to shorter sleep, aligning with Khan and Aouad (2017) on stress and cardiovascular impacts on sleep.\n",
    "\n",
    "Age had a modest positive association, implying that older individuals tend to sleep longer, very likely due to age-related changes in lifestyle or sleep needs. The negative association with Daily1000Steps was unexpected, as it is also a form of physical activity,  we suspect this unlikely result to be due to multicollinearity, although not handled by stepAIC. Occupation also played a significant role. Professions like OccupationDoctor , OccupationSalesRepresentative , and OccupationLawyer were associated with longer sleep duration compared to the reference group, potentially due to differences in work schedules or socioeconomic factors. However, OccupationManager showed no significant effect, indicating that occupational influences on sleep are not uniform.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interestingly, SleepDisorderPresent was positively associated with sleep duration, a counterintuitive finding. This could reflect compensatory behaviors, such as spending more time in bed to offset poor sleep quality, or it may point to a limitation in the data or model specification.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model’s adjusted R-squared of 0.9043 indicates that it explains a substantial portion of the variability in sleep duration, with a residual standard error of 0.2484 suggesting a good fit. However, residuals ranging from -0.8889 to 0.9432 hint at some unaccounted variability, possibly due to omitted factors like diet or mental health.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations\n",
    "Several limitations temper these findings:\n",
    "- While associations are clear, we cannot determine whether predictors like stress or physical activity directly influence sleep duration. \n",
    "- The sample size (374 observations) is relatively small, potentially limiting the generalizability of results, especially for less-represented occupations or conditions like sleep disorders.\n",
    "- Also, the fact that this dataset is generated might make it not so representative of the actual population. \n",
    "Self-reported measures (if we consider the dataset as a result of random survey), such as sleep quality and stress level, may introduce bias due to subjectivity. \n",
    "- Lastly, the unexpected positive association with sleep disorders gives suspicious results, as it could stem from unmeasured confounders or data artifacts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implications and Future Directions\n",
    "These findings underscore the multifaceted nature of sleep health. The positive roles of sleep quality and physical activity suggest that interventions promoting exercise and sleep hygiene could enhance sleep duration. Conversely, the negative effects of stress and systolic pressure highlight the need for stress management and cardiovascular health strategies in sleep interventions. Occupation-specific differences suggest that workplace wellness programs could be tailored to support sleep health, particularly in high-stress roles.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, this analysis reveals significant associations between sleep duration and a range of lifestyle and health-related factors. While the model offers robust explanatory power, its cross-sectional design and reliance on self-reported data call for cautious interpretation. Future research could leverage longitudinal data, objective measures (e.g., actigraphy for sleep, wearable devices for activity), and additional variables (e.g., diet, mental health) to strengthen these findings. Exploring interactions between factors, such as stress and physical activity, could further illuminate their combined effects on sleep. These steps would enhance our understanding of sleep health and inform targeted strategies to improve well-being."
